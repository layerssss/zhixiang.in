Intersting Cantonese Culture: Piggy-selling
===========================================  
##Interesting Clash  

Today I took a long-distance coach from Guangzhou back to Zhuhai. In Guangzhou, when headding into the coach, a girl with a student-look inquired the driver, 'Sir, this coach gonna stop at Gongbei, right? The ticketwomen was there. So the driver just replied with a fooling smill 'no, we're not going to Gongbei'. And the ticketwomen instantle apologized to the girl 'Oh, he's justing joking. Forget about him.' The driver went on, 'We're not going to Gongbei. And I will sell you as soon as we get to Zhuhai. Haha, got you a _direct coach_ or something." The girl surely knew that the driver is joking, but she didn't come accross of him, so she just murmured:'aha? You won't get much money from selling me, right?'  

##What Did the Driver Originally Mean?

The driver said 'I will sell you as soon as we get to Zhuhai'. Lots of people might thoulght, is the driver's joke too hash? The girl is just a student from another town. But you're using _humen trading_ to make jokes. What if you frightened her?

Actually driver's 'I will sell you' means 'I will piggy-sell you' which completely didn't refer to _humen trading_. Piggy-sell is a now not only a word in Cantonese, but also in vocabulary of Madarin spoken by people who live in Guangdong. I remember that before I went to university, one of my relatives told me to take care of myself, don't be piggy-sold by coach drivers. And I was instantly frightened, until I found piggy-selling's meanning on Internet. And it's not as frightening as it might looks like.

Just like, Guangdong people may sometimes say:

Damn, I've been piggy-sold again today.

##What is Piggy-selling?

[Piggy] originnaly means those Chinese workers been sold as slaves abroad more than one hundred years ago. They're mostly came from provinces of Guangdong and Fujian. During 70s-80s, because of the Open&Revolution policy, lots of workers from other provinces in China came into Guangdong, bring lots prosperitis to Guangdong's coach transportation. Therefore, lot of illigal coached was running arround and sometimes cheat passengers by dropping them off at half way, by some excuses like 'something wrong with the coach'. Guangdong people started to call this kind of cheating as piggy-selling.

After that, those kind of illigal cheating became fewer. But it sometimes still existed. Those drivers became shrewder, by calling another coach to take passengers and theirselves just ran away. Then the another coach's driver can drop passengers easier because then nobody is authoritive about where should the destination be. 

Now we nearly don't see this anymore. Because everybody learnt what is it and how to protect ourselves from been piggy-sold. But Guangdong people are still happy at adapting this phrase, and they started to use it everywhere, instead of just coach transportation. Eg. you're reparing your friend's computer. And you want to give it up and you don't wanna let down your friend, so you give it to somebody else and tell your friends 'Just call him, he'll take care that.' Then your friends can say to you 'Ok, then you just sold me.'
