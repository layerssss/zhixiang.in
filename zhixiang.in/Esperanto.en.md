Esperanto  
=============  

I started to learn [Esperanto] last week. Althought it's a very-easy-to-learn language, I'm very slow at it, because I don't have lots of time. So for me, I will spend 1 hour per day on it. 

##Kurso de Esperanto  
[Kurso de Esperanto] is a softwere which can help you learn [Esperanto]. It consists of 12 lessons. I'm currently using it, and I feel it's pretty good.

##Complementary gramma notes   

As mentioned above, [Kurso de Esperanto] is a great learning tool of Esperanto, but I find some gramma knowledge are missing in the learning flow. I'll try to list them here respectively.
