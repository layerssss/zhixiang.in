Esperanto  
=============  

I started to learn [Esperanto] in April this year. Althought it's a very-easy-to-learn language, I'm very slow at it, because I don't have lots of time. So for me, I will spend 1 hour per day on it. 

##Kurso de Esperanto  
[Kurso de Esperanto] is a softwere which can help you learn [Esperanto]. It consists of 12 lessons. I'm currently using it, and I feel it's pretty good.
   
*  __[Chinese Lessions](Esperanto-Chinese.en)__  
The current version of [Kurso de Esperanto] doesn't contain a Chinese translation. So I tried to translate them into Chinese, and put them online.
