Esperanto  
=============  

I started to learn [Esperanto] in April this year. Althought it's a very-easy-to-learn language, I'm very slow at it, because I don't have lots of time. So for me, I will spend 1 hour per day on it. 
As a beginner, I recorded the process I got started, what I did, and what I felt, also here can be found some useful resources for you! Hope you enjoy!

## Getting Started
######Michael's getting started diary.  

* [Hey, get __excited__](Esperanto-Diary1.en)!  
  Oh, you're going to learn such a special language now. How do you feel? Quite internationalism, huh?
* [Do you have __time__](Esperanto-Diary2.en)?  
   There's a not-quite-old saying in Chinese: 
   > time is water in sponge, which we can always get more after squezing a little bit.  

* [You need some __vanities__](Esperanto-Diary3.en)!  
   Yep, we need that.
